Gesture: Play / Pause
Problem: Music restarted multiple times while hand was still up.
Cause: Frame-by-frame detection triggered repeated inputs.
Solution: Added state logic and cooldown system.

Gesture: Volume Up / Down
Problem: Confused with open_palm or thumbs_up.
Cause: Similar finger posture and overlapping landmarks.
Solution: Added hold confirmation + retrained with 60 new samples per gesture.

Gesture: Spotify Focus
Problem: Spotify window not always detected.
Cause: “Spotify” title overlapped with VSCode or OpenCV windows.
Solution: Refined focus detection, ignored “Code”, “main.py”, and “OpenCV”.

Gesture: Webcam Lag
Problem: Frame rate dropped to <10 FPS.
Cause: High resolution and continuous landmark processing.
Solution: Reduced resolution to 640×480 and added frame delay.

Gesture: Model Accuracy
Problem: Some gestures misclassified.
Cause: Class imbalance in dataset.
Solution: Expanded dataset to 2115 total samples and retrained for 94.9% accuracy.

Gesture: Stability
Problem: Sudden flickering between gestures.
Cause: Model reacted to single-frame variations.
Solution: Added frame buffer confirmation logic.

# TODO: Add new gesture issues (e.g., minimize, maximize, playlist control)
